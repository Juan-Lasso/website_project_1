    <div class = "content">
    <p> Valley Stream District 13 has seen a thinning student population for years, with over 220 fewer students enrolled today than a decade ago. Yet, as student enrollment has fallen, the amount of money spent on their learning continues to tick up. Adjusted for inflation, the district spent $20,457 per student in 2014. Flash forward to today, that figure has climbed to $25,314. </p>

    <p> District 13's per-student spending is not a statistically striking sum compared to the state average — $26,000 — but nationally, it ranks on the high end. Policymakers have questioned the sustainability of an ever-soaring school funding standard, especially for seemingly overfunded districts with declining enrollment.</p>

    <p> “Schools have pretty fixed costs,” said David Bloomfield, an education professor at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center. But when those fixed expenses are spread over a dwindling student population, it “puts financial pressure on the district locally and in terms of state funding.”
